= Mailing for Spring

Spring provides mail started dependency that makes working with xref:java-mail.adoc[Jakarta Mail] easier.

The main advantage Spring abstraction provides is that we don't have to deal with jakarta Session in any way.

Additionally, Spring also provides helper classes to make constructing email messages easier.

By including dependency in your project:

[indent=0]
----
include::example$pom.xml[tag=spring-boot-mail-starter-dependency]
----

and defining ```spring.mail.*``` properties for host, port, username and password:
----
include::example$src/main/resources/application.properties[tag=spring-mail-basic-properties]
----

Spring autoconfigures and exposes **JavaMailSender** bean which we can inject and use to send mail.

If we need to send simple text messages, we can use ```SimpleMailMessage``` and for html messages and for messages using inline images and attachments we can ```MimeMessage``` (multipart message).
