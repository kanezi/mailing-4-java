= Mail Servers

To send mail we'll need to have access to SMTP Server (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Server).

For local development we can set up tools like link:https://mailpit.axllent.org/[MailPit] that act as local SMTP server and intercept mails we send.

Google offers free SMTP service for our Gmail accounts we can use as well.

When we need to scale we can transition to dedicated email services, like link:https://www.mailgun.com/[MailGun].
